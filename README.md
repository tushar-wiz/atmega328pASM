# Collection of Assembly Programs
All programs have been coded using the Microchip Studio IDE for the Atmega328p microcontroller.  
  

All the programs were flashed using Avrdude to the microcontroller.  
  
*The microcontroller had Arduino's Optiboot Bootloader*  

For asm files not placed in directories such as blinkNoTimer.asm, addition16bit.asm etc, do not have a Microchip Studio Project file.
